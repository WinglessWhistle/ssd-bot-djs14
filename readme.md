Right now our little bot is named Clippy.
Yellow hasn't been seen for a few weeks, that's kinda sus bro.

## How do I run it.

- Clone this repository.
- Install node.js v16 and above along with npm.
- run `npm install` to install all the dependences for the bot.
- rename `example.config.json` to `config.json`. 
- Add the token to `config.json` file you just renamed.
- Run the bot with `npm run start`.
